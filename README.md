# zSockets (WIP)

zSockets is a from-scratch zig implementation of the [µSockets](https://github.com/uNetworking/uSockets) library. The name is a play on [uSockets](https://github.com/uNetworking/uSockets), where the "µ" represents the metric prefix for micro (1e−6); here, the `z` represents the metric prefix for zepto (1e-21) and the zig programming language.
